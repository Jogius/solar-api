# solar-api

> A PHP API that exposes endpoints to create and read solar yield data from a database.

## Instructions

To use this API, you need to have a server running MySQL, PHP (tested with version 8.0) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Copy the contents of [src](https://github.com/Jogius/solar-api/tree/master/src) to a directory of your choice and run 
```bash
composer install
```

Additionally, copy [.env.example](https://github.com/Jogius/solar-api/tree/master/src/.env.example) to a new file named ``.env`` in the same directory and add the database connection details.
